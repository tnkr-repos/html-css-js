- Each website is stored on a server (a computer that is connected to the
internet and is able to handle HTTP requests)

- When we try to access a website, the browser will send a request to a server
where the website is hosted on the internet

- The server will then send all the files that make up the website and send it
to the browser (The server "responds" to the request, and the response contains
all the files required to "render" the website in the browser)

- The files are HTML, CSS and JavaScript files as the browser can understand
only these languages. 

- Front-end web development involves writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript code that
can be understood and rendered on the browser for others to see

- Whenever we have files that are simply stored on a web server, and the files
are directly sent to the browser as they are, these files form a static website

- For complex websites, the functioning is different from that of a static
website. There is a whole application running on the web server, along with a
database that contains all the data required for the application to function.
Backend technologies such as PHP, Python, Java, NodeJS are required to handle
such tasks on the web server, and then generate the files from the data in the
database which can then be sent to the browser as a response for the users to
view. This is called Back-end Development

- This website is a dynamic website because the website is generated dynamically
each time a user visits the website using different pieces on the server. Once
the files have been assembled, they are sent to the browser as a response to be
rendered (just as in the case of static websites)

- Front-end Technologies:
  - HTML - For handling content of a webpage
  - CSS - For styling content of a webpage
  - JavaScript - Allows us to add dynamic and interactive effects on the webpage
  It can also be used to manipulate content, or the CSS, to load data from web
  servers and build entire front-end applications (called "web applications")

- Everything on the internet has its own URL
