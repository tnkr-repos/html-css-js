## PROCESS BEHIND BUILDING A WEBSITE

- Define the project (from a developer standpoint, not marketing standpoint)
  - Who the website is for? - Yourself or freelancing business
  - What is the website for? - Business and User Goals of website (Defining
  what the website is for from User Experience point of view) - (Providing
  information, selling some product, or entertain the user are most common)
      - Business Goal - Selling premium dog food
      - User Goal - Finding high-quality dog food for good price
  - Define a target audience - Be really specific if possible
      - Women, 20 to 40 years old, living in Europe, earning 2000/month with a
      passion for dogs

- Plan the project
  - Plan and gather the website content (text, images, videos, etc)
  - For bigger websites plan out the sitemap (what pages the sites needs, and
  how they are related to one another - content hierarchy)
  - Plan what sections each page needs in order to convey the content's
  message, and in which order
  - The content should define the design of the website, and not vice-versa
  - Based on the company, the project and its content, define the website
  personality
  
- Sketch layout and component ideas
  - Think about the component that you need, and how you can use them in
  layout patterns
  - Sketch ideas with pen and paper
  - This is an iterative process -> experiment with different components and
  layouts, until you arrive at a first good solution. You can change this when
  you are implementing these ideas in code
  - No need to sketch everything and make it perfect

- Design and build website
  - Using HTML and CSS in the browser
  - Layouts and Components have already been selected. Now design the actual
  visual styles
  - Design should be based on selected website personality and the design
  guidelines and inspiration
  - Use the client's branding (if it exists already) for design decisions
  whenever possible: icons, colors, typography, etc.

- Test and Optimise
  - Check browser compatibility
  - Test the website on actual mobile devices
  - Optimise all images (give them the right dimensions in px, and compress
  them in order to not force our users to download huge images)
  - Fix simple accessibility problems (color contrast issues, etc.)
  - Run the Lighthouse performance test in Chrome DevTools and try and fix
  reported issues
  - Track your SEO

- Launch the website
  - Upload the website on a hosting platform (Netlify free plan)
  - Choose and buy a domain name

- Maintain and keep updating the website
  - Keep the website content updated over time
  - Install analytics software (Google Analytics or Fathom) to get statistics
  about website users. This may inform future changes in site structure and
  content
  - A blog that is regularly updated is a good way to keep users coming back,
  and is also good for SEO
