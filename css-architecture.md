- Component Driven Design
    - Break our page into reusable components 
    - They are joined by layout of the page to form the interface
    - They should be completely reusable, even across projects
    - They should be independent of their parent so that they can be used
    anywhere on the page

- How should you name your classes in HTML and CSS?
    - Use the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention
